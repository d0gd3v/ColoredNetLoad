ColoredNetLoad
==============
This is an Android Xposed module that allows changing color of network upload/download signalization in status bar. Stock gray signalization with high "alpha transparency" is almost unnoticeable for my eyes. There is possibility to choose from various colors, independently for WiFi and Mobile data signalization.
Primary developed just for my purposes, but it could be usable also for someone else.
Developed and tested on SG2/CM10.2.

Requirements:
This is just module and requires Xposed Framework. It does NOTHING without it.

-Xposed Framework http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401 (tested on 2.4.1)  
-Cyanogenmod 10.2 ROM. (Perhaps could work also on other CM9+ up to 4.3.x and related AOSP based ROMs(NOT TESTED!).
